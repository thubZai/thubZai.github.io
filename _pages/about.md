### How are you guys doing?
Well, I'm doing great just like you...thanks for asking, btw! 😊 Here’s a glimpse into the things that light up my world!

🔭 I have deep curiosity and research interests in exploring **Multimodal Learning**, particularly **VLMs, MLLMs, Diffusion** with insights from **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

📌Check out the repository I've created - [**Vision-Language Models (VLMs) Research Hub**](https://github.com/thubZ09/vision-language-model-hub.git). I thought having a community-driven hub for multimodal researchers would be great. Contributions are welcome!

📚 I have a borderline obsession with research papers. Check out my [Reading List](https://huggingface.co/collections/thubZ9/my-reading-list-677bbae8877a0efbab57392f) for what’s been keeping me up lately!

✍️ I enjoy jotting down my thoughts. You can find my blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thube09), [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/) and [InPlainEnglish](https://plainenglish.io/author/yash-thube).

🌿 Outside of work, you’ll find me clicking random pictures, exploring astrophysics, or playing and watching a variety of sports!! - be it football, cricket, MMA, or Esports. A good book recommendation or a meaningful conversation? I’m all ears!

## 🔧Personal ML Toolkit
