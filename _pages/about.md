### How are you guys doing?
Well, I'm doing great just like you...Thanks for asking, btw! 😊 Here’s a glimpse into the things that light up my world!

🧠 I’m captivated by the ever-evolving world of Machine Learning, with a deep curiosity and research interests in exploring **Multimodal Learning**, with insights from **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

📚 I have a borderline obsession with research papers - reading, reimplementing, and occasionally losing sleep over them. Check out my [Reading List](https://huggingface.co/collections/thubZ9/my-reading-list-677bbae8877a0efbab57392f) for what’s been keeping me up lately!

✍️ Breaking down complex concepts through blogs is my jam. You can find my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thube09), [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/) and [InPlainEnglish](https://plainenglish.io/author/yash-thube).

🌿 Outside of work, you’ll find me clicking random pictures, or exploring nature and stargazing. I love playing and watching sports!! - be it football, cricket, MMA, or Esports. A good book recommendation or a meaningful conversation? I’m all ears!

## 🔧Personal AI Toolkit
#### Here’s a curated list of my go-to tools and libraries, grouped by purpose:

### **For Vision Tasks🖼️**
📌**OpenCV**: Versatile for image preprocessing and augmentation.   
📦**PyTorch and torchvision**: Perfect for implementing custom CNNs and Vision Transformers.  
🚀**YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: My favorite for real-time object detection, especially in sports analytics.  
⚡**TensorFlow & Keras**: Excellent for rapid prototyping and deploying pre-trained models.  
📸**scikit-image**: Ideal for advanced image processing tasks like segmentation and denoising.  
🖌️**Pillow**: Perfect for quick image transformations like resizing, cropping, and format conversion.

### **For NLP Tasks📝**
💬**Hugging Face Transformers**: Simplifies using state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and GPT.  
✂️**NLTK & SpaCy**: Handy for preprocessing and annotating text data efficiently.

### **For Experiment Tracking📊**
✔️**Weights & Biases (W&B)**: Makes model tracking and optimization seamless with intuitive visualizations.

### **For Deployment🚀**
🌐**Hugging Face Spaces**: Allows me to create interactive demos with ease.  
☁️**AWS SageMaker**: Simplifies scaling ML experiments to production.
