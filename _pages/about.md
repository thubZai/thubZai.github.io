### Hello! How are you guys doing?
Well, I'm doing great just like you...thanks for asking, btw.

True intelligence emerges when a system can perceive and reason across modalities in unfamiliar settings, going well beyond surface‚Äêlevel pattern recognition. Mostly, I try to follow research from these domains: 
- **vision-language modeling** 
- **interpretability in vision**
- **compositional & spatial reasoning**
- **cross-modal generalization**
- **alignment & safety**

I like to understand architectures that mirror aspects of human cognition, ensuring that they remain *trustworthy*, *efficient* and *aligned with human values*. I remain open to exploring adjacent research problems, broadly in ***Computer Vision & Multimodal Learning*** and applying them in the fields of ***Astrophysics***, ***Cognitive Science***, ***Medical AI*** and ***Robotics & Autonomous systems***.

üìåCheck out [**Multimodal/VLMs Research Hub**](https://github.com/thubZ09/vision-language-model-hub.git). I thought having a community-driven hub for multimodal researchers would be great. Contributions are welcome!

‚úçÔ∏è I enjoy jotting down my thoughts and keeping an organized ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù, unlike my primary one:) You can find some interesting stuff in the brain dump section above. [**Here**](https://www.notion.so/Paper-Discussions-195d4ed038df41f7a3a9ff23870c773c) I like to discuss insights from the papers that have been keeping me up lately!
  
Outside of work, you‚Äôll find me clicking random pictures, reading, trekking or playing and watching a variety of sports (football, cricket, MMA, & Esports).
