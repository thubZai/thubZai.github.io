How are you guys doing?....Well, I'm doing great just like you... thanks for asking, btw! Here are some things that light up my world (❁´◡`❁)

🧠 I’m captivated by the ever-evolving world of Machine Learning, with a deep curiosity and research interests in Multimodal Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP.

📚 I have a borderline obsession with research papers - reading, reimplementing, and occasionally losing sleep over them. Check out my [Reading List](https://huggingface.co/collections/thubZ9/my-reading-list-677bbae8877a0efbab57392f) for what’s been keeping me up lately!

🔧 I enjoy working with PyTorch, OpenCV, Hugging Face, Tensorflow, Foundation Models and Deep learning architectures. Open source is love!

🌩️ A fan of all things scalable, I often experiment with AWS services like SageMaker and Rekognition to put my ideas into action.

✍️ Breaking down complex concepts through blogs is my jam. You can find my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thube09) and [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/).

🌳 Outside of work, you’ll find me snapping random pictures, or exploring nature. I love playing and watching sports!! - be it football, cricket, MMA, or Esports. A good book recommendation or a meaningful conversation? I’m all ears!
