### Hello! How are you guys doing?
Well, I'm doing great just like you...thanks for asking, btw.

True intelligence emerges when a system can perceive and reason across modalities in unfamiliar settings, going well beyond surface‚Äêlevel pattern recognition. Mostly, I try to follow research from these domains: 
- *Vision-language modeling* 
- *Mechanistic Interpretability in vision/multimodal models*
- *Multimodal perception (compositional & spatial reasoning)*
- *Reinforcement Learning*
- *Self-Supervised learning in vision*

I believe this is one of the greatest leaps humanity has ever made, and if we're bold enough with good intentions, we can solve some of the most complex problems **(protein folding, drug discovery, cognitive & neuroscience, robotics & embodied AI, environmental/climate change, quantum/astro physics & cosmology**) to radically improve the lives of billions. The impact is gonna far surpass the current aspirations for AGI/ASI. I remain open to exploring adjacent research problems, broadly in **Computer Vision & Multimodal Learning**.

üìåCheck out [Multimodal/VLMs Research Hub](https://github.com/thubZ09/vision-language-model-hub.git). I thought having a community-driven hub for multimodal researchers would be great. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!

‚úçÔ∏è I enjoy jotting down my thoughts and keeping an organized ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù, unlike my primary one:) You can find some interesting stuff in the brain dump section above. 

Outside of work, you‚Äôll find me clicking random pictures, reading, trekking or playing and watching a variety of sports (football, cricket, MMA, & Esports).
