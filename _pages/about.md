### How are you guys doing?
Well, I'm doing great just like you...thanks for asking, btw!

🔭 My curiosity lies in **Vision-Language modeling** and its potential to enable multimodal perceptual abilities closer to human cognition, with a focus on **interpretability**, **efficiency**, **cross-modal generalization**, **multimodal reasoning**, **alignment & safety**!

📌Check out [**Multimodal/VLMs Research Hub**](https://github.com/thubZ09/vision-language-model-hub.git). I thought having a community-driven hub for multimodal researchers would be great. Contributions are welcome!

✍️ I enjoy jotting down my thoughts and keeping an organized “second brain”, unlike my own primary one:) You can find some interesting stuff in the brain dump section above. [**Here**](https://www.notion.so/Paper-Discussions-195d4ed038df41f7a3a9ff23870c773c) I like to discuss insights from the papers that have been keeping me up lately!
  
Outside of work, you’ll find me clicking random pictures, reading, exploring astrophysics, or playing and watching a variety of sports!! - be it football, cricket, MMA, or Esports.
