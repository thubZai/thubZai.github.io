### How are you guys doing?
Well, I'm doing great just like you...thanks for asking, btw!

True intelligence emerges when a system can perceive and reason across modalities in unfamiliar settings, going well beyond surface‚Äêlevel pattern recognition to **compositional and spatial reasoning**. I believe **vision and video language modeling** sits at the heart of this challenge, offering a path to isolate essential features from both visual and textual inputs and recombine them in novel contexts. I like to explore architectures that mirror aspects of human cognition, ensuring that they remain **transparent**, **trustworthy**, and **aligned with human values**.   
While my central focus is on advancing vision‚Äêlanguage methods toward more humanlike perceptual abilities, I remain open to exploring adjacent research problems, **anything that pushes AI closer to genuine understanding and reliable, multimodal reasoning**.

üìåCheck out [**Multimodal/VLMs Research Hub**](https://github.com/thubZ09/vision-language-model-hub.git). I thought having a community-driven hub for multimodal researchers would be great. Contributions are welcome!

‚úçÔ∏è I enjoy jotting down my thoughts and keeping an organized ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù, unlike my own primary one:) You can find some interesting stuff in the brain dump section above. [**Here**](https://www.notion.so/Paper-Discussions-195d4ed038df41f7a3a9ff23870c773c) I like to discuss insights from the papers that have been keeping me up lately!
  
Outside of work, you‚Äôll find me clicking random pictures, reading, exploring astrophysics, or playing and watching a variety of sports!! - be it football, cricket, MMA, or Esports.
